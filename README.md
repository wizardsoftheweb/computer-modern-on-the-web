# Computer Modern on the Web

This is a mirror of [Computer Modern on the Web](https://www.checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/), a project I've been using fairly regularly for some time. All credit goes to Christian Lawson-Perfect for putting it together. Recently his cert expired, and I remembered nothing on the internet lasts. He's since renewed it, but I believe it's better to be safe than sorry.

The `fonts` directory is just the `Computer Modern.zip` unzipped and renamed. I'm not sure what the original structure was.

## Licenses

### Repo Contents

All credit for the original work goes to Christian Lawson-Perfect. I'm not sure what the original license was, so don't reproduce this without his permission. I'll be taking this down if there are any complaints.

### Fonts

> These fonts are released under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL), so you can basically use them wherever you like (this is not legal advice)
